# Trackify

### Trackify is GPS sign-in app for remote workers.

Workers can sign in through the app once they reach the job site, and their location and time of arrival are stored and sent to their employer to confirm correct sign-in location. 

Employees can check-in at any job-site, and employers can manage the the time and location of their employee sign-ins.
